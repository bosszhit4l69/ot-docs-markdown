# DITA Open Toolkit Overview

The DITA Open Toolkit \(DITA-OT\) is an open-source implementation of the OASIS DITA specification, which is developed by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee. The DITA-OT is a set of Java-based, open-source tools that transform DITA content \(maps and topics\) into deliverable formats, including PDF, HTML, HTML Help, Eclipse Help, and JavaHelp.

While the DITA standard is owned and developed by OASIS, the DITA-OT project is governed separately; the DITA-OT is an independent, open-source implementation of the DITA standard. The DITA-OT is available without charge and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open-source licenses.

# DITA to PDF \(PDF2\)

The pdf \(or pdf2\) transformation generates PDF output.

This transformation was originally created as a plug-in and maintained outside of the main toolkit code. It was created as a more robust alternative to the demo PDF transformation in the original toolkit, and thus was known as PDF2. The plug-in was bundled into the default toolkit distribution with release 1.4.3.

# DITA to Java Help

The javahelp transformation will generate Java Help output, along with the control files needed to compile the project.

The Java Help output produces HTML files rather than XHTML files. In addition to the HTML output and CSS files, this transformation type will return the following files:

-   Table of Contents \(toc.xml\)
-   Sorted index \(mapname\_index.xml\)
-   Other Java Help project files \(map.jhm and mapname\_helpset.hs\)
-   If the Java Help compiler is located on the system, a compiled Java Help project will be returned.

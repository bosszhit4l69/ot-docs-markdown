# DITA to TocJS

The tocjs transformation generates XHTML output, a frameset, and a JavaScript-based table of contents with expandable and collapsible entries. The transformation was originally created by Shawn McKenzie as a plug-in and was added to the default distribution in DITA-OT release 1.5.4.

The tocjs transformation was updated so that it produces XHTML output and uses a default frameset.

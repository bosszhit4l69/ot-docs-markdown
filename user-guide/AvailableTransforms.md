# DITA-OT transformations \(output formats\)

The DITA Open Toolkit ships with several core transformations that generate different output formats from DITA content. Each transformation represents an implementation of the processing that is defined by OASIS in the DITA specification.

-   **[DITA to DocBook](../user-guide/dita2docbook.md)**  
The docbook transformation converts DITA maps and topics into a DocBook output file. Complex DITA markup might not be supported, but the transformation supports most common DITA structures.
-   **[DITA to Eclipse Content](../user-guide/dita2eclipsecontent.md)**  
The eclipsecontent transformation generates normalized DITA files and Eclipse control files. It originally was designed for an Eclipse plug-in that dynamically rendered DITA content, but the output from the transformation can be used by other applications that work with DITA.
-   **[DITA to Eclipse help](../user-guide/dita2eclipsehelp.md)**  
Theeclipsehelp transformation generates XHTML output, CSS files, and the control files that are needed for Eclipse help.
-   **[DITA to HTML5](../user-guide/dita2html5.md)**  
The html5 transformation generates HTML5 output and a table of contents \(TOC\) file.
-   **[DITA to HTML Help \(CHM\)](../user-guide/dita2htmlhelp.md)**  
The htmlhelp transformation generates HTML output, CSS files, and the control files that are needed to produce a Microsoft HTML Help file.
-   **[DITA to Java Help](../user-guide/dita2javahelp.md)**  
The javahelp transformation will generate Java Help output, along with the control files needed to compile the project.
-   **[DITA to Open Document Type](../user-guide/dita2odt.md)**  
The odt transformation produces output files that use the Open Document format, which is used by tools such as Open Office.
-   **[DITA to PDF \(PDF2\)](../user-guide/dita2pdf.md)**  
The pdf \(or pdf2\) transformation generates PDF output.
-   **[DITA to Rich Text Format](../user-guide/dita2wordrtf.md)**  
The wordrtf transformation produces an RTF file for use by Microsoft Word.
-   **[DITA to TocJS](../user-guide/dita2tocjs.md)**  
The tocjs transformation generates XHTML output, a frameset, and a JavaScript-based table of contents with expandable and collapsible entries. The transformation was originally created by Shawn McKenzie as a plug-in and was added to the default distribution in DITA-OT release 1.5.4.
-   **[DITA to troff](../user-guide/dita2troff.md)**  
The troff transformation produces output for use with the troff viewer on Unix-style platforms, particularly for programs such as the man page viewer.
-   **[DITA to XHTML](../user-guide/dita2xhtml.md)**  
The xhtml transformation generates XHTML output and a table of contents \(TOC\) file. This was the first transformation created for the DITA Open Toolkit, and it is the basis for all the HTML-based transformations.

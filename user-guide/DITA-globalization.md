# Globalizing DITA content

The DITA standard supports content that is written in or translated to any language. In general, the DITA Open Toolkit passes content through to the output format unchanged. The DITA-OT uses the values for the @xml:lang, @translate, and @dir attributes that are set in the source content to provide globalization support.

-   **[Globalization support offered by the DITA-OT](../user-guide/globalization-supported-in-dita-ot.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit offers globalization support in the following areas: Generated text, index sorting, and bi-directional text.
-   **[Supported languages: HTML-based transformations](../user-guide/DITA-globalization-xhtml.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit supports over 50 languages and language variants for the HTML-based transformations such as HTML5, XHTML, Eclipse Help, HTML Help, and TocJS.
-   **[Supported languages: PDF transformations](../user-guide/DITA-globalization-pdf.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit supports a smaller set of languages for the PDF \(pdf2\) transformation. This transformation was donated to the DITA-OT project after the project inception, and it uses a different and larger set of generated text than the HTML-based transformations.

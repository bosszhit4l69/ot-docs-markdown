# DITA specification support

DITA Open Toolkit 2.2 supports all standard versions of DITA, including 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, with preview support for the DITA 1.3 specification.

-   **[DITA 1.2 support](../user-guide/DITA_v1-2-support.md)**  
DITA Open Toolkit 2.2 supports the DITA 1.2 specification. Initial support for this specification was added in version 1.5 of the toolkit; versions 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 contain minor modifications to keep up with the latest drafts. The specification itself was approved at approximately the same time as DITA-OT 1.5.2, which contained the final versions of the DTD and Schemas. DITA-OT 1.6 updated the DITA 1.2 XSDs to address minor errata in the standard; the DTDs remain up to date.
-   **[DITA 1.3 support](../user-guide/DITA_v1-3-support.md)**  
DITA Open Toolkit 2.2 provides processing support for the OASIS DITA 1.3 specification. Initial preview support for this specification was added in version 2.0 of the toolkit; version 2.2 extends this foundation to support key scopes and branch filtering along with additional DITA 1.3 features.

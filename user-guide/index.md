# DITA Open Toolkit User Guide

The User Guide is designed to provide basic information about the DITA-OT. It is geared for an audience that needs information about installing, running, and troubleshooting the toolkit. It contains information on the supported DITA versions and the versions of components that have been tested for use with the toolkit.

-   **[DITA Open Toolkit Overview](../user-guide/overview-of-dita-ot.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit \(DITA-OT\) is an open-source implementation of the OASIS DITA specification, which is developed by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee. The DITA-OT is a set of Java-based, open-source tools that transform DITA content \(maps and topics\) into deliverable formats, including PDF, HTML, HTML Help, Eclipse Help, and JavaHelp.
-   **[Installing the DITA Open Toolkit](../user-guide/installing.md)**  
You can install the DITA Open Toolkit on Linux, Mac OSÂ X, and Windows.
-   **[Publishing DITA content](../user-guide/transforming-dita-content.md)**  
You can use either Ant or the command-line tool to transform DITA content to the various output formats that are supported by the DITA Open Toolkit.
-   **[DITA-OT transformations \(output formats\)](../user-guide/AvailableTransforms.md)**  
The DITA Open Toolkit ships with several core transformations that generate different output formats from DITA content. Each transformation represents an implementation of the processing that is defined by OASIS in the DITA specification.
-   **[Extending the DITA Open Toolkit](../user-guide/extending-the-dita-ot.md)**  
Plug-ins can be used to extend the functionality and configure the DITA Open Toolkit.
-   **[Globalizing DITA content](../user-guide/DITA-globalization.md)**  
The DITA standard supports content that is written in or translated to any language. In general, the DITA Open Toolkit passes content through to the output format unchanged. The DITA-OT uses the values for the @xml:lang, @translate, and @dir attributes that are set in the source content to provide globalization support.
-   **[Error messages and troubleshooting](../user-guide/troubleshooting-overview.md)**  
This section contains information about problems that you might encounter and how to resolve them.

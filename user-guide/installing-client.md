# Installing the distribution package

The DITA-OT distribution package can be installed on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It contains everything that you need to run the toolkit except for Java.

-   Ensure that you have Java JRE or JDK, version 7 or later installed.
-   Ensure that you have HTML Help Workshop installed, if you want to generate HTML Help.

1.   Download the package for your operating system from the project website at [www.dita-ot.org](http://www.dita-ot.org/download). 

    |Operating system|File name|
    |----------------|---------|
    |**Linux or Mac OS X **|dita-ot-2.2.2.tar.gz|
    |**Windows**|dita-ot-2.2.2.zip|

2.   Extract the contents of the package to the directory where you want to install the DITA-OT. 
3.   Add the absolute path for the bin directory to the PATH system variable. 

    This defines the necessary environment variable to run the dita command from the command line.

    **Tip:** This step is recommended, as it allows the the dita command to be run from any location on the file system and makes it easier to transform DITA content from any folder.

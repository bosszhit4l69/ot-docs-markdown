# Publishing DITA content from Ant

You can use Ant to invoke the DITA Open Toolkit and generate output. You can use the complete set of parameters that are supported by the toolkit.

-   **[Ant](../user-guide/ant.md)**  
Ant is a Java-based, open-source tool that is provided by the Apache Foundation. It can be used to declare a sequence of build actions. It is well suited for both development and document builds. The toolkit ships with a copy of Ant.
-   **[Building output using Ant](../user-guide/building-with-ant.md)**  
You can build output by using an Ant build script to provide the DITA-OT parameters.
-   **[Creating an Ant build script](../user-guide/creating-an-ant-build-script.md)**  
Instead of typing the DITA-OT parameters at the command prompt, you might want to create an Ant build script that contains all of the parameters.

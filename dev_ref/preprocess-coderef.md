# Resolve code references \(coderef\)

The `coderef` step resolves references made with the <coderef\> element. This step is implemented in Java.

The <coderef\> element is used to reference code stored externally in non-XML documents. During the pre-processing step, the referenced content is pulled into the containing <codeblock\> element.

# DITA Open Toolkit Markdown Demonstration

This repository includes a snapshot of the [DITA Open Toolkit][dita-ot] docs in Markdown.

The output was generated via the [DITA-OT Markdown plug-in][github] for publication via [GitBook][gitbook] to illustrate the capabilities of modern collaboration and publishing toolchains based on Markdown and how they may be combined with DITA content.

Since plain-text formats like Markdown are inherently simple, they cannot represent the full range of semantics encoded in DITA content, so some information is lost in translation when exporting DITA content to Markdown.

With that in mind, if you see errors in the exported Markdown or have suggestions on enhancing the Markdown conversion routine, please submit them to [jelovirt/dita-ot-markdown/issues][github 2].

If you notice issues in the content of the docs themselves, please report them via [dita-ot/docs/issues][github 3].

The content shown here was generated from the [DITA-OT 2.2.2 docs][github 4] as hosted on the project website at <http://www.dita-ot.org/2.2>.

# Getting Started with the DITA Open Toolkit

 Getting Started provides a guided exploration of the DITA Open Toolkit. It is geared for an audience that has little or no knowledge of build scripts or DITA-OT parameters. It walks the novice user through installing the toolkit and building output.

1.  [Installing the distribution package](../getting-started/installing-client.md)  
The DITA-OT distribution package can be installed on Linux, Mac OSÂ X, and Windows. It contains everything that you need to run the toolkit except for Java.
2.  [Building output using the dita command](../getting-started/first-build-using-dita-command.md)  
DITA-OT includes a dita command-line tool. You can invoke the DITA-OT from the command-line tool and generate output.
